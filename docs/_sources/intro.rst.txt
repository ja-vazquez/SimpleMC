* :ref:`General structure`


Generally speaking, the steps to run ``SimpleMC``  are as follows: 1) configure an :ref:`ini file`, 2) read this in a :ref:`Python script`, 3) :ref:`run in terminal`, and 4) :ref:`analyze outputs`.

The main output of Bayesian inference algoritms (mcmc and nested) are text files that have the same structure of the `CosmoMC <https://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/>`_ chains consisting in:

	- First column.- weights of the sampling method. 
	- Second column.- log-likelihood function.
	- Third to N+2 columns.- N free parameters of the cosmological model under analysis. 
	- Last columns.- log-likelihood function per each type of data and derived parameters.

In addition, two other output files are generated: a summary and a ``.paramnames`` file with the names of the free parameters of the cosmological model. 


..  _Requirements:

Requirements
-------------

This code runs both in Python 2x and 3x. However, we highly recommend Python 3x. 

Imperative libraries are:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   sudo pip install numpy matplotlib scipy 


Only if you want to use EMCEE sampler: 

.. code-block:: bash
   
   sudo pip install emcee


Optionally, MCEvidence is necessary to estimate the bayesian evidence in the Metropolis-Hastings sampler:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install git+https://github.com/yabebalFantaye/MCEvidence

To use Artificial Neural Networks with nested sampling or to learn likelihood functions, you need to install:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install tensorflow keras

To use genetic algorithms in order to maximize the Likelihood function:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install deap


If you want the full options to plot:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install corner getdist


.. note:: All in one copy-paste line: 

   .. code-block:: bash
   
      pip install numpy matplotlib scipy tensorflow keras corner getdist deap git+https://github.com/yabebalFantaye/MCEvidence

To run MCMC analyzer (Metropolis-Hastings) in parallel you need to have `MPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/>`_  in your computer and then install the Python library:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install mpi4py

this requirement is not necessary if you want to use nested sampling or optimization algorithms.

..  _Quick Start:

Quick Start
------------

In this section we show a basic four steps to use ``SimpleMC``:

1. Set an :ref:`ini file`.
2. Read the configuration in a :ref:`Python script`.
3. Then :ref:`run in terminal`. 
4. Finally :ref:`analyze outputs`. 


..  _ini file:

ini file
***********


The ``ini file`` has all the necessary options to ``SimpleMC``, the mandatory options are in the ``[custom]`` section, the rest have default values corresponding to specific analyzers and you can modify them accordingly with your needs  (see `Customize inifile <inifile.html>`_ or  `baseConfig <inifile.html#baseconfig-ini>`_.ini file for more information).

The ``[custom]`` section has the following structure:

.. code-block::

        [custom]

        chainsdir = chains
        
        model = LCDM
        
        datasets = BBAO+HD+SN

        analyzer = mcmc


you must choose an existing directory to save the outputs (chains, summary, and .paramnames). The options for model, datasets and analyzer are as follows:

.. note::

	* model options:
		* LCDM, LCDMasslessnu, nuLCDM, NeffLCDM, noradLCDM, nuoLCDM, nuwLCDM, oLCDM, wCDM, waCDM, owCDM, owaCDM, JordiCDM, WeirdCDM, TLight, StepCDM, Spline, PolyCDM, fPolyCDM, Decay, Decay01, Decay05, EarlyDE, EarlyDE_rd_DE, SlowRDE, sline


	* analyzer options: 
		* mcmc, nested, emcee, MaxLikeAnalyzer, genetic, ga_deap


   	* data options (you can combine any of them): 
   		* HD, BBAO, GBAO, GBAO_no6dF, CMASS, LBAO, LaBAO, LxBAO, MGS, Planck, WMAP, PlRd, WRd, PlDa, PlRdx10, CMBW, SN, SNx10, UnionSN, RiessH0, 6dFGS, dline


..  _Python script:

Python script
*************

We can use ``test.py`` with the path of the ``ini file``:

.. code-block:: python
   
   from simplemc.DriverMC import DriverMC
   
   fileConfig = "path/baseConfig.ini"
   D = DriverMC(fileConfig)


..  _run in terminal:

run in terminal
****************

For last, run in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ python test.py

To run multiple MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) chains in parallel:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   mpirun -np 4 python test.py

where 4 is the number of chains and the number of processors.  

..  _analyze outputs:

analyze outputs
****************

You can see the outputs in the chains directory and then make plots. See the `plots <plotters.html>`_ section for details. The name of the outputs begins with the name of the model, prefact (pre / phy), datasets and analyzer, for the example of the above ``ini file``: ``LCDM_phy_BBAO+HD+SN_mcmc``.

In addition to the chain file, it is a summary where you can notice the parameter estimation, the execution time and in the case of nested sampling, the Bayesian evidence, useful for the comparison of models.
